LizardFS is a networking, distributed file system.

It spreads data over several physical locations (servers), which are visible to a user as one resource (available through FUSE).

LizardFS is fault tolerant at data level, not (yet) completely on metadata level.

The goals behind LizardFS are:

    Providing free:
        - Highly Reliable,
        - Highly Scalable,
        - Highly Available,
        - Highly Secure,
        - Highly Efficient file system solution.
    Adapting modern agile development of distributed system in C++:
        - git - https://github.com/lizardfs/lizardfs,
        - jenkins (for access please contact contact@lizardfs.org),
        - gerrit (for access please contact contact@lizardfs.org),
        - unit testing.
    Active cooperation with open source community.
    Developing test infrastructure standards for distributed file systems.

LizardFS is a fork of MooseFS.

Motivations behind creating this fork are:

    - rare updates of git repository,
    - lack of community (only 2 developers made commits to public git repository at sourceforge),
    - increase in the number of possible contributors with a simultaneous lack of response on the part of moosefs maintainers,
    - our ability to perfect the tool.
