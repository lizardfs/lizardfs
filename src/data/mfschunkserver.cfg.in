## Nice level to run daemon with (default is -19 if possible).
# NICE_LEVEL = -19

## Where to store data files and daemon lock file:
## (Default: @DATA_PATH@)

## Timeout (in seconds) for the master server connection (minimum is 0.01).
## (Default: 60)

## Name of volume configuration file.
## (Default: @ETC_PATH@/mfshdd.cfg)
# HDD_CONF_FILENAME = @ETC_PATH@/mfshdd.cfg

## Free space threshold to set volume as 100% utilized when there is less than given amount of free
## space left. This number is always added to the used disk space reported by chunkserver.
## (Default: 4GiB)

## Whether to remove each chunk from page when closing it to reduce cache pressure
## generated by chunkserver, boolean (0 means "no").
## (Default: 0)
# HDD_ADVISE_NO_CACHE = 0

## If enabled then chunkserver detects zero values in chunk data and frees
## corresponding file blocks (decreasing file system usage).
## This option works only on Linux
## with file systems supporting punching holes (XFS, ext4, Btrfs, tmpfs).
## (Default : 0)
# HDD_PUNCH_HOLES = 1

## If enabled, chunkserver will send periodical reports of its I/O load to master,
## which will be taken into consideration when picking chunkservers for I/O operations.
## (Default : 0)

## Limit how many kilobytes can be replicated from other chunkservers to
## this chunkserver in every second (by default undefined, i.e. no limits)
# REPLICATION_BANDWIDTH_LIMIT_KBPS = 8192

## Number of threads which handle (in a round-robin manner) connections
## with clients; these threads are responsible for reading from
## sockets and coping data from internal buffers to sockets.
## (Default: 1)

## Number of threads that each network worker may use to do disk operations
## like opening chunks, reading or writing them

## additional number of kilobytes which should be passed to
## posix_fadvise(POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED) before reading data from a chunk
## (Default: 0), i.e. use posix_fadvise only with the amount of data that is
##  really needed; the value is aligned down to 64 KiB.
# READ_AHEAD_KB = 0

## Try to fix out-of-order read requests; the value tells how much of
## skipped data to read if an offset of some read operation is greater than
## the offset where the previos operation finished
## (Default: 0), i.e. don't read any skipped data; the value is aligned down to 64 KiB.
# MAX_READ_BEHIND_KB = 0

## Whether to create new chunks in the MooseFS format
##    (signature + <checksum>* + <data block>*)
## or in the newer interleaved format
##    ([<checksum> <data block>]*).
## (Default: 1), i.e. new chunks are created in MooseFS format.
# CREATE_NEW_CHUNKS_IN_MOOSEFS_FORMAT = 1
