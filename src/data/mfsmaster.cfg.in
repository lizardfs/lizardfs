# mfsmaster.cfg(5)

## Personality of this instance of metadata server ('master' or 'shadow').
## 'master' means that this instance of metadata server acts as main
## metadata server govering all file system metadata modifications.
## 'shadow' means that this instance of metadata server acts as backup
## metadata server ready for immediate deployment as new 'master' in case
## of current 'master' failure.
