# But you don't have to specify all of them -- defaults will be assumed (min(goal_id, 5) standard copies).

# You can define your own custom goals using labes if you use them, e.g.:
# 14 min_two_locations: _ locationA locationB  # one copy in A, one in B, third anywhere
# 15 fast_access      : ssd _ _                # one copy on ssd, two additional on any drives
# 16 two_manufacturers: WD HT                  # one on WD disk, one on HT disk
