This file contains some important notes on upgrade process.

* Upgrading to LizardFS 2.5.4:

    Direct upgrade is possible from:
    - MooseFS  1.6.27 -- 1.6.27-5
    - LizardFS 1.6.28 -- 2.5.2

    When upgrading from LizardFS 2.5.0 or 2.5.2:
    - Upgrade shadow master servers before the master server; shadow master will always
      refuse to connect to the master server in any newer version.
    - Upgrade the master server before any chunkserver or client.
    - Clients, chunkservers and the master server can be upgraded in any order (all of them
      are compatible with each other), either one by one or all at once.
    - CGI server 2.5.4 is compatible with all versions of the master server (1.6.27 -- 2.5.2),
      so it can be upgraded at any time. Because of a bug in older versions of the CGI server
      it has to be stopped manually before being upgraded (otherwise installation of the newer
      package may fail).

    When upgrading from other releases:
    - Proceed the same as in case of upgrade to LizardFS 2.5.2.

    When upgrading from previous releases:
