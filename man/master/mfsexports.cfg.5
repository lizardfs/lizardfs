.TH MFSEXPORTS.CFG "5" "July 2009" "MooseFS 1.6.0"
.SH NAME
mfsexports.cfg \- MooseFS access control for \fBmfsmount\fPs
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file \fBmfsexports.cfg\fP contains MooseFS access list for \fBmfsmount\fP
clients.
.SH SYNTAX
.PP
Syntax is:
.TP
\fIADDRESS\fP \fIDIRECTORY\fP [\fIOPTIONS\fP]
.PP
Lines starting with \fB#\fP character are ignored as comments.
.PP
\fIADDRESS\fP can be specified in several forms:
.PP
.nf
.ta +2i
\fB*\fP	all addresses
\fBn.n.n.n\fP	single IP address
\fBn.n.n.n/b\fP	IP class specified by network address and bits number
\fBn.n.n.n/m.m.m.m\fP	IP class specified by network address and mask
\fBf.f.f.f-t.t.t.t\fP	IP range specified by from-to addresses (inclusive)
.fi
.PP
\fIDIRECTORY\fP could be \fB/\fP or path relative to MooseFS root; special
value \fB.\fP means MFSMETA companion filesystem.
.PP
\fIOPTIONS\fP list:
.TP
\fBro\fP, \fBreadonly\fP
export tree in read-only mode (default)
.TP
\fBrw\fP, \fBreadwrite\fP
export tree in read-write mode
.TP
\fBignoregid\fP
disable testing of group access at \fBmfsmaster\fP level (it's still done
at \fBmfsmount\fP level) - in this case "group" and "other" permissions are
logically added; needed for supplementary groups to work (\fBmfsmaster\fP
receives only user primary group information)
.TP
\fBdynamicip\fP
allows reconnecting of already authenticated client from any IP address
(the default is to check IP address on reconnect)
.TP
\fBmaproot=\fP\fIUSER\fP[\fB:\fP\fIGROUP\fP]
maps root (uid=0) accesses to given user and group (similarly to maproot
option in NFS mounts); \fIUSER\fP and \fIGROUP\fP can be given either as
name or number; if no group is specified, \fIUSER\fP's primary group is
used. Names are resolved on \fBmfsmaster\fP side (see note below).
.TP
\fBmapall=\fP\fIUSER\fP[\fB:\fP\fIGROUP\fP]
like above but maps all non privileged users (uid!=0) accesses to given
user and group (see notes below).
.TP
\fBminversion=\fP\fIVER\fP
rejects access from clients older than specified
.TP
\fBmingoal=\fP\fIN\fP, \fBmaxgoal=\fP\fIN\fP
specify range in which goal can be set by users
.TP
\fBmintrashtime=\fP\fITDUR\fP, \fBmaxtrashtime=\fP\fITDUR\fP
specify range in which trashtime can be set by users
.TP
\fBpassword=\fP\fIPASS\fP, \fBmd5pass=\fP\fIMD5\fP
requires password authentication in order to access specified resource
.TP
\fBalldirs\fP
allows to mount any subdirectory of specified directory (similarly to NFS)
.PP
Default options are: \fBro,maproot=999:999\fP.
.SH NOTES
\fIUSER\fP and \fIGROUP\fP names (if not specified by explicit uid/gid
number) are resolved on \fBmfsmaster\fP host.
.PP
TDUR can be specified as number without time unit (number of seconds) or
combination of numbers with time units. Time units are:
\fBW\fP,\fBD\fP,\fBH\fP,\fBM\fP,\fBS\fP. Order is important - less
significant time units can't be defined before more significant time units.
.PP
Option \fBmapall\fP works in MooseFS in different way than in NFS, because of
using FUSE's "default_permissions" option. When mapall option is used, users
see all objects with uid equal to mapped uid as their own and all other as
root's objects. Similarly objects with gid equal to mapped gid are seen as
objects with current user's primary group and all other objects as objects
with group 0 (usually wheel). With \fBmapall\fP option set attribute cache
in kernel is always turned off.
.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.ta +2i
\fB*                    /       ro\fP
\fB192.168.1.0/24       /       rw\fP
\fB192.168.1.0/24       /       rw,alldirs,maproot=0,password=passcode\fP
\fB10.0.0.0-10.0.0.5    /test   rw,maproot=nobody,password=test\fP
\fB10.1.0.0/255.255.0.0 /public rw,mapall=1000:1000\fP
\fB10.2.0.0/16          /       rw,alldirs,maproot=0,mintrashtime=2h30m,maxtrashtime=2w\fP
