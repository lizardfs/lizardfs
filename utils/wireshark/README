About the wireshark plugin
==========================

This directory contains a script, which generates a plugin for wireshark (http://www.wireshark.org/)
which adds support for the LizardFS protocol. This plugin is compiled into a .so shared library
to make it easily redistributable, because the build process is a bit complicated:

* Checkout the wireshark sources, eg:
      ( cd ~ && git clone http://code.wireshark.org/git/wireshark )
* Checkout your version of wireshark
      wireshark --version
      ( cd ~/wireshark && git checkout wireshark-1.8.2 )
* Copy contents of this directory to the wireshark source directory
      tar -C lizardfs/utils/wireshark -c . | tar -C ~/wireshark -vx
* Run the generate.sh script (provide path to the MFSCommunication file as an argument)
      ~/wireshark/plugins/lizardfs/generate.sh lizardfs/src/common/MFSCommunication.h
* Edit the main CMakeLists.txt file in the wireshark source tree to add the new plugin
      vim ~/wireshark/CMakeLists.txt

* Build the wireshark using cmake (you don't have to build the GUI)
      mkdir ~/wireshark/build
      cd ~/wireshark/build
      cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_wireshark=NO
      make -j8
* Install the plugin, eg. on Debian-like distros:
      sudo cp ~/wireshark/build/lib/lizardfs.so /usr/lib/wireshark/libwireshark2/plugins/
* Enjoy! This plugin recognizes the LizardFS proocol using TCP port numbers. If you use
  non-standard ports (9419-9422) you have to change it in Edit->Preferences->Protocols->LizardFS,
  eg. to parse the communication in our test suite:
      LizardFS TCP Ports: 9419-9422,25000-25015
