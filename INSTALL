Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to install LizardFS is to execute following commands
in project's top level directory:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make && make install

First command  creates a directory  for all content  generated during
a building of a project and gets in it. Next one runs a build process
which collects system-dependent  variables and prepares a source code
to  build. It also generates 'Makefile'  which has  all  necessary
information about compilation. The last command launches a compilation
and installs LizardFS in default location.

Configuration
=============

It is suggested to create another user and group for LizardFS execution.
To  do  it  please check  that  the chosen user name  is  unoccupied.
Sample command  creating user  with analogous group and home directory:

    adduser --system --group --no-create-home --home /var/lib/mfs mfs

LizardFS needs to be configured before the work. Template configuration
files are located in configuration directory (default: '/etc/mfs')
in files '*.cfg.dist'.

Basic configuration
-------------------

- mfsmaster.cfg -  add lines:

    WORKING_USER = mfs
    WORKING_GROUP = mfs

- mfschunkserver.cfg - add lines:

    WORKING_USER = mfs
    WORKING_GROUP = mfs
    HDD_CONF_FILENAME = /* path to 'mfshdd.cfg' file, e.g. '/etc/mfs/mfshdd.cfg' */

- mfshdd.cfg - add paths to storage separated by returns

- mfsexports.cfg - copy a file 'mfsexports.cfg.dist'

LizardFS stores metadata file in variables directory (default: '/usr/var/lib/mfs/').
To create empty storage copy 'metadata.mfs.empty' to 'metadata.mfs'.
