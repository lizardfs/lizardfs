== NAME

lfsfilerepair - repair broken files

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
*lfsfilerepair* [*-n*|*-h*|*-H*] 'FILE'...

== DESCRIPTION

*lfsfilerepair* deals with broken files (those which cause I/O errors on read operations) to make
them partially readable. In case of missing chunk it fills missing parts of file with zeros; in case
of chunk version mismatch it sets chunk version known to *lfsmaster* to highest one found on
chunkservers.

NOTE: Because in the second case content mismatch can occur in chunks with the same version, it's
advised to make a copy (not a snapshot!) and delete original file after "repairing".

== OPTIONS
