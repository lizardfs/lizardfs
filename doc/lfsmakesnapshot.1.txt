lfsmakesnapshot(1)
==================

== NAME

lfsmakesnapshot - make lazy copies

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
*lfsmakesnapshot* [*-o*] 'SOURCE'... 'DESTINATION'

== DESCRIPTION

*lfsmakesnapshot* makes a "real" snapshot (lazy copy, like in case of *lfsappendchunks*) of some
object(s) or subtree (similarly to *cp -r* command). It's atomic with respect to each 'SOURCE'
argument separately. If 'DESTINATION' points to already existing file, error will be reported unless
*-o* (overwrite) option is given.

NOTE: if 'SOURCE' is a directory, it's copied as a whole; but if it's followed by trailing slash,
only directory content is copied.
