globaliolimits.cfg(5)
=====================

== NAME

globaliolimits.cfg - global I/O limiting configuration

== DESCRIPTION

The file *globaliolimits.cfg* contains configuration of the global I/O limiter.

== SYNTAX

Syntax is:

'option' 'value'

Lines starting with *#* character are ignored.

== OPTIONS

Configuration options:

*subsystem <subsystem>*::
The cgroups subsystem by which clients are classified.
If left unspecified, all clients are considered 'unclassified' (see below).

*limit unclassified <throughput in KiB/s>*::
This is a special entry for clients that don't match any group specified in
configuration file or for all clients if *subsystem* is unspecified.
If this entry is unspecified and subsystem is unspecified as well, I/O limiting
is disabled entirely. If this entry is unspecified but subsystem is specified,
unclassified clients are not allowed to perform I/O.

*limit <group> <throughput in KiB/s>*::
Set limit for clients belonging to the cgroups group *<group>*.
In LizardFS, subgroups of *<group>* constitute independent groups; they are not
allowed to use *<group>'s* bandwidth reservation and they don't count against
*<group>'s* usage.

== EXAMPLES

 # empty file

I/O limiting is disabled, no limits are enforced.

 limit unclassified 1024

All clients are 'unclassified' and share 1MiB/s of bandwidth.

 subsystem blkio
 limit /a 1024

Clients in the *blkio* */a* group are limited to 1MiB/s, no other clients can
perform any I/O.

 subsystem blkio
 limit unclassified 256
 limit /a   1024
 limit /b/a 2048

The *blkio* group */a* is allowed to transfer 1MiB/s, while */b/a* gets 2MiB/s.
Clients from other groups (e.g. */b*, */z*, */a/a*, */b/z*) are considered
'unclassified' and share 256KiB/s of bandwidth.

== TUNING NOTES

Global I/O limiting is managed by the master server. Mount instances reserve
bandwidth allocations from master when they want to perform I/O to
chunkservers.

To avoid overloading the master under heavy traffic, mounts try to predict their
future usage and reserve at once all the bandwidth they will for the next
renegotiation period (see mfsmaster.cfg(5)).

Such reservation are wasted if the traffic at given mount instance suddenly
drops.

The ratio of bandwidth being wasted due to this phenomenon shouldn't exceed
*fsp/b*, where:

 f is the frequency of sudden traffic drops in the whole installation (in 1/s)
 s is the average size of such drop (in KiB/s)
 p is the renegotiation period (in s)
 b is the bandwidth limit (in KiB/s)

This applies to each group separately, because groups reserve their bandwidth
independently from each other.
