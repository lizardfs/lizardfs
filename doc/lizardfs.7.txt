== NAME

lizardfs, lizardfs, lfs - a networking, distributed, highly available file system

== DESCRIPTION

LizardFS is a networking, highly available, distributed
file system. It spreads data over several physical
localisations (servers), which are visible to a user as one resource. For standard file operations
LizardFS acts as other Unix-alike file systems. It has hierarchical structure (directory tree),
stores files' attributes (permissions, last access and modification times) as well as makes it
possible to create special files (block and character devices, pipes and sockets), symbolic links
(file names pointing to another files accessible locally, not necessarily on LizardFS) and hard links
(different names of files which refer to the same data on LizardFS). Access to the file system can be
limited basing on IP address and/or password.

Distinctive features of LizardFS are:

 - higher reliability (data can be stored in several copies on separate computers)

 - dynamically expanding disk space by attaching new computers/disks

 - possibility of storing deleted files for a defined period of time ("trash bin" service on a file
   system level)

 - possibility of creating snapshot of a file, which means coherent copy of them whole file, even
   while the file is being written.


== ARCHITECTURE

LizardFS installation consists of five types of machines:

 - master metadata server (or `the master') a managing server - single computer managing the whole
   filesystem, storing metadata for every file (information on size, attributes and file
   localisation(s), including all information about non-regular files, i.e. directories,
   sockets, pipes and devices.

 - metadata server shadows (or `the shadow') - almost identical to the master,
   there can be any number  of those, they work as master metadata server backup and they are ready
   for immediate deployment as new master in case of current master failure.

 - data servers (any number of commodity servers storing files data and replicating it among
   themselves (if a certain file is supposed to exist in more than one copy).

 - metadata backup servers - any number of servers, all of which store metadata changelogs and
   periodically downloading base metadata file; it's easy to run lfsmaster process on such machine when
   primary master stops working.

 - client computers referring to LizardFS stored files - any number of machines with working lfsmount
   process that communicates with the managing server to receive and modify file information and with
   chunkservers to exchange actual file data.


Metadata is stored in memory of the managing server and simultaneously is being saved on disk (as a
periodically updated binary file and immediately updated incremental logs). The main binary file as
well as the logs are replicated to metaloggers (if present).


File data is divided to fragments (chunks) of maximum size 64MB each which are stored as files on
selected disks on data servers (chunkservers). Each chunk is saved on different computers in a
number of copies equal to a "goal" for the given file.
