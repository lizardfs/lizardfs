mfstopology.cfg(5)
==================

== NAME

mfstopology.cfg - LizardFS network topology definitions

== DESCRIPTION

The file *mfstopology.cfg* contains assignments of IP addresses into network locations (usually
switch numbers). This file is optional. If your network has one switch or decreasing traffic between
switches is not necessary then leave this file empty.

== SYNTAX

Syntax is:

'ADDRESS' 'SWITCH-NUMBER'

Lines starting with *#* character are ignored.

'ADDRESS' can be specified in several forms:

- *** all addresses

- *n.n.n.n* single IP address

- *n.n.n.n/b* IP class specified by network address and bits number

- *n.n.n.n/m.m.m.m* IP class specified by network address and mask

- *f.f.f.f-t.t.t.t* IP range specified by from-to addresses (inclusive)


'SWITCH-NUMBER' can be specified as any positive 32-bit number.

== NOTES

If one IP belongs to more than one definition then last definition is used.

As for now distance between switches is constant. So distance between machines is calculated as: *0*
when IP numbers are the same, *1* when IP numbers are different, but switch numbers are the same and
*2* when switch numbers are different

Distances are used only to sort chunkservers during read and write operations. New chunks are still
created randomly. Also rebalance routines do not take distances into account.
