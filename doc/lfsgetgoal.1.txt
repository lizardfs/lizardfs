===========

== NAME

lfsgetgoal, lfssetgoal, lfsrgetgoal, lfsrsetgoal - change or retrieve goal

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
*lfsgetgoal* [*-r*] [*-n*|*-h*|*-H*] 'OBJECT'...

[verse]
*lfsrgetgoal* [*-n*|*-h*|*-H*] 'OBJECT'...

[verse]
*lfssetgoal* [*-r*] [*-n*|*-h*|*-H*] GOAL_NAME[*+*|*-*] 'OBJECT'...

[verse]
*lfsrsetgoal* [*-n*|*-h*|*-H*] GOAL_NAME[*+*|*-*] 'OBJECT'...

== DESCRIPTION

*lfsgetgoal* and *lfssetgoal* operate on object's replication 'goals', see
lfsgoals.cfg(5). These tools can be used on any file, directory or deleted ('trash') file.

== OPTIONS

*-r*::
This option enables recursive mode, which works as usual for every given file, but for every given
directory additionally prints current value of all contained objects (files and directories).

'GOAL_NAME'[*+*|*-*]::
*lfssetgoal* changes current 'goal' of given object(s). If new value is specified in 'GOAL_NAME'*+*
form, 'goal' is changed to 'GOAL_NAME' for objects whose goals have lower 'goal id' than 'GOAL_NAME'
and is unchanged for the rest.
Similarly, if new value is specified as 'GOAL_NAME'*-*, 'goal' is changed to 'GOAL_NAME' for objects
with higher goal id and unchanged for the rest.

*-n*, *-h*, *-H*::
These options are described in lfstools(1).

== NOTE

*lfsrgetgoal* and *lfsrsetgoal* are deprecated aliases for
*lfsgetgoal -r* and *lfssetgoal -r* respectively.
