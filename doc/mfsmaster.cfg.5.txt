================

== NAME

mfsmaster.cfg - main configuration file for mfsmaster

== DESCRIPTION

The file *mfsmaster.cfg* contains configuration of LizardFS metadata server process.

== SYNTAX

Syntax is:

'OPTION' *=* 'VALUE'

Lines starting with *#* character are ignored.

== OPTIONS

Configuration options:

*PERSONALITY*::
Current 'personality' of this instance of metadata server.
Valid values are 'master' and 'shadow'. Only one metadata server in LizardFS shall have 'master'
personality. +
PERSONALITY = 'master' +
means that this instance of metadata server acts as main metadata server
govering all file system metadata modifications. +
PERSONALITY = 'shadow' +
means that this instance of metadata server acts as backup metadata server
ready for immediate deployment as new 'master' in case of current 'master' failure. +
Metadata server personality can be changed at any moment as long as one changes personality from
'shadow' to 'master', changing personality the other way around is forbidden.

*DATA_PATH*::
where to store metadata files and lock file

*LOCK_FILE*::
(deprecated)
daemon lock/pid file

*WORKING_USER*::
user to run daemon as

*WORKING_GROUP*::
group to run daemon as (optional - if empty then default user group will be used)

*SYSLOG_IDENT*::
name of process to place in syslog messages (default is mfsmaster)

*LOCK_MEMORY*::
whether to perform mlockall() to avoid swapping out mfsmaster process (default is 0, i.e. no)

*NICE_LEVEL*::
nice level to run daemon with (default is -19 if possible; note: process must be started as root to
increase priority)

*EXPORTS_FILENAME*::
alternative name of *mfsexports.cfg* file

*TOPOLOGY_FILENAME*::
alternative name of *mfstopology.cfg* file

*CUSTOM_GOALS_FILENAME*::
alternative name of *mfsgoals.cfg* file

*BACK_LOGS*::
number of metadata change log files (default is 50)

*BACK_META_KEEP_PREVIOUS*::
number of previous metadata files to be kept (default is 1)

*AUTO_RECOVERY*::
when this option is set (equals 1) master will try to recover metadata from changelog when it
is being started after a crash; otherwise it will refuse to start and 'mfsmetarestore' should be
used to recover the metadata (default is 0)

*REPLICATIONS_DELAY_INIT*::
initial delay in seconds before starting replications (default is 300)

*REPLICATIONS_DELAY_DISCONNECT*::
replication delay in seconds after chunkserver disconnection (default is 3600)

*MATOML_LISTEN_HOST*::
IP address to listen on for metalogger connections (*** means any)

*MATOML_LISTEN_PORT*::
port to listen on for metalogger connections (default is 9419)

*MATOML_LOG_PRESERVE_SECONDS*::
how many seconds of change logs have to be preserved in memory (default is 600; note: logs are
stored in blocks of 5k lines, so sometimes real number of seconds may be little bigger; zero
disables extra logs storage)

*MATOCS_LISTEN_HOST*::
IP address to listen on for chunkserver connections (*** means any)

*MATOCS_LISTEN_PORT*::
Port to listen on for chunkserver connections (default is 9420)

*MATOCL_LISTEN_HOST*::
IP address to listen on for client (mount) connections (*** means any)

*MATOCL_LISTEN_PORT*::
Port to listen on for client (mount) connections (default is 9421)

*CHUNKS_LOOP_MIN_TIME*::
Chunks loop shouldn't be done in less seconds than given number (default is 300)

*CHUNKS_LOOP_MAX_CPS*::
Chunks loop shouldn't check more chunks per seconds than given number (default is 100000)

*CHUNKS_SOFT_DEL_LIMIT*::
Soft maximum number of chunks to delete on one chunkserver (default is 10)

*CHUNKS_HARD_DEL_LIMIT*::
Hard maximum number of chunks to delete on one chunkserver (default is 25)

*CHUNKS_WRITE_REP_LIMIT*::
Maximum number of chunks to replicate to one chunkserver (default is 2)

*CHUNKS_READ_REP_LIMIT*::
Maximum number of chunks to replicate from one chunkserver (default is 10)

*ACCEPTABLE_DIFFERENCE*::
A maxmim difference between disk usage on chunkservers that doesn't trigger chunk rebalancing
(default is 0.1, i.e. 10%).

*CHUNKS_REBALANCING_BETWEEN_LABELS*::
When balancing disk usage, allow moving chunks between servers with different labels
(default is 0, i.e. chunks will be moved only between servers with the same label).

*EMPTY_TRASH_PERIOD*::
Interval of removing files from trash in seconds (default is 300)

*EMPTY_RESERVED_INODES_PERIOD*::
Interval of removing reserved files in seconds (default is 60)

*FREE_INODES_PERIOD*::
Interval of freeing inodes being unused for longer than 24 hours in seconds (default is 60)

*REJECT_OLD_CLIENTS*::
Reject **mfsmount**s older than 1.6.0 (0 or 1, default is 0). Note that *mfsexports* access control
is NOT used for those old clients.

*GLOBALIOLIMITS_FILENAME*::
Configuration of global I/O limits (default is no I/O limiting)

*GLOBALIOLIMITS_RENEGOTIATION_PERIOD_SECONDS*::
How often mountpoints will request bandwidth allocations under constant, predictable load
(default is 0.1)

*GLOBALIOLIMITS_ACCUMULATE_MS*::
After inactivity, no waiting is required to transfer the amount of data equivalent to normal
data flow over the period of that many milliseconds (default is 250)

*METADATA_CHECKSUM_INTERVAL*::
how often metadata checksum shall be sent to backup servers (default is: every 50 metadata updates)

*METADATA_CHECKSUM_RECALCULATION_SPEED*::
how fast should metadata be recalculated in background (default : 100 objects per function call)

*DISABLE_METADATA_CHECKSUM_VERIFICATION*::
should checksum verification be disabled while applying changelog

*SAVE_METADATA_AT_EXIT*::
enable dumping metadata when performed a 'stop' or 'restart' action (default is 1)

*PREFER_LOCAL_CHUNKSERVER*::
If a client mountpoint has a local chunkserver, and a given chunk happens to
reside locally, then mfsmaster will list the local chunkserver first.
However, when the local client mount is issuing many read(s)/write(s), to many
local chunks, these requests can overload the local chunkserver and disk
subsystem.  Setting this to 0(the default is 1) means that remote chunkservers
will be considered as equivalent to the local chunkserver. +
This is useful when the network is faster than the disk, and when there is
high-IO load on the client mountpoints.

Options below are mandatory for all Shadow instances:

*MASTER_HOST*::
address of the host running LizardFS metadata server that currently acts as 'master'

*MASTER_PORT*::
port number where LizardFS metadata server currently running as 'master' listens for connections
from 'shadow's and metaloggers (default is 9420)

*MASTER_RECONNECTION_DELAY*::
delay in seconds before trying to reconnect to metadata server after disconnection (default is 30)

*MASTER_TIMEOUT*::
timeout (in seconds) for metadata server connections (default is 60)

== NOTES

Chunks in master are tested in loop. Speed (or frequency) is regulated by two options
*CHUNKS_LOOP_MIN_TIME* and *CHUNKS_LOOP_MAX_CPS*. First defines minimal time of the loop and second
maximal number of chunk tests per second. Typically at the beginning, when number of chunks is
small, time is constant, regulated by *CHUNK_LOOP_MIN_TIME*, but when number of chunks became bigger
then time of loop can increase according to *CHUNKS_LOOP_MAX_CPS*.

Deletion limits are defined as 'soft' and 'hard' limit. When number of chunks to delete increases
from loop to loop then current limit can be temporary increased above soft limit, but never above
hard limit.
