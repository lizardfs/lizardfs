========================

== NAME

lizardfs-appendchunks - lazy append chunks

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
*lizardfs appendchunks* 'SNAPSHOT_FILE' 'OBJECT'...

== DESCRIPTION

*appendchunks* (equivalent of *mfssnapshot* from MooseFS 1.5) appends a lazy copy of specified
file(s) to specified snapshot file ("lazy" means that creation of new chunks is delayed to the
moment one copy is modified). If multiple files are given, they are merged into one target file in
the way that each file begins at 'chunk' (64MB) boundary; padding space is left empty.
