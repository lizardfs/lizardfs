===========

== NAME

mfsgetgoal, mfssetgoal, mfsrgetgoal, mfsrsetgoal - change or retrieve goal

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
*mfsgetgoal* [*-r*] [*-n*|*-h*|*-H*] 'OBJECT'...

[verse]
*mfsrgetgoal* [*-n*|*-h*|*-H*] 'OBJECT'...

[verse]
*mfssetgoal* [*-r*] [*-n*|*-h*|*-H*] GOAL_NAME[*+*|*-*] 'OBJECT'...

[verse]
*mfsrsetgoal* [*-n*|*-h*|*-H*] GOAL_NAME[*+*|*-*] 'OBJECT'...

== DESCRIPTION

*mfsgetgoal* and *mfssetgoal* operate on object's replication 'goals', see
mfsgoals.cfg(5). These tools can be used on any file, directory or deleted ('trash') file.

== OPTIONS

*-r*::
This option enables recursive mode, which works as usual for every given file, but for every given
directory additionally prints current value of all contained objects (files and directories).

'GOAL_NAME'[*+*|*-*]::
*mfssetgoal* changes current 'goal' of given object(s). If new value is specified in 'GOAL_NAME'*+*
form, 'goal' is changed to 'GOAL_NAME' for objects whose goals have lower 'goal id' than 'GOAL_NAME'
and is unchanged for the rest.
Similarly, if new value is specified as 'GOAL_NAME'*-*, 'goal' is changed to 'GOAL_NAME' for objects
with higher goal id and unchanged for the rest.

*-n*, *-h*, *-H*::
These options are described in mfstools(1).

== NOTE

*mfsrgetgoal* and *mfsrsetgoal* are deprecated aliases for
*mfsgetgoal -r* and *mfssetgoal -r* respectively.
