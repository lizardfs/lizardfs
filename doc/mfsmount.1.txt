== DESCRIPTION

Mount Lizard File System.

General options:

*-h*, *--help*::
display help and exit

*-V*::
display version information and exit

FUSE options:

*-d*, *-o debug*::
enable debug mode (implies *-f*)

*-f*::
foreground operation

*-s*::
disable multi-threaded operation

LizardFS options:

*-c* 'CFGFILE', *-o mfscfgfile=*'CFGFILE'::
loads file with additional mount options

*-m*, *--meta*, *-o mfsmeta*::
mount MFSMETA companion filesystem instead of primary LizardFS

*-n*::
omit default mount options (*-o allow_other,default_permissions*)

*-p*, *-o askpassword*::
prompt for password (interactive version of *-o mfspassword=*'PASS')

*-H* 'HOST', *-o mfsmaster=*'HOST'::
connect with LizardFS master on 'HOST' (default is mfsmaster)

*-P* 'PORT', *-o mfsport=*'PORT'::
connect with LizardFS master on 'PORT' (default is 9421)

*-B* 'HOST', *-o mfsbind=*'HOST'::
local address to use for connecting with master instead of default one

*-S* 'PATH', *-o mfssubfolder=*'PATH'::
mount specified LizardFS directory (default is /, i.e. whole filesystem)

*-o enablefilelocks=*[0,1]::
enables/disables global file locking (disabled by default)

*-o mfspassword=*'PASSWORD'::

*-o mfsmd5pass=*'MD5'::
authenticate to LizardFS master using directly given 'MD5' (only if *mfspassword* option is not
specified)

*-o mfsdelayedinit*::
connection with master is done in background - with this option mount can be run without network
(good for being run from fstab / init scripts etc.)

*-o mfsacl*::
enable ACL support (disabled by default)

*-o mfsaclcacheto=*'SEC'::
set ACL cache timeout in seconds (default: 1.0)

*-o mfsaclcachesize=*'N'::
define ACL cache size in number of entries (0: no cache; default: 1000)

*-o mfsrwlock=*'0|1'::
when set to 1, parallel reads from the same descriptor are performed (default: 1)

*-o mfsmkdircopysgid=*'N'::
sgid bit should be copied during mkdir operation (on linux default: 1, otherwise: 0)

*-o mfssugidclearmode=*'SMODE'::
set sugid clear mode (see below)

*-o mfsdebug*::
print some LizardFS-specific debugging information

*-o mfscachemode=*'CACHEMODE'::
set cache mode (see *DATA CACHE MODES*; default is AUTO)

*-o mfscachefiles*::
(deprecated) preserve file data in cache (equivalent to *-o mfscachemode=*'YES')

*-o mfsattrcacheto=*'SEC'::
set attributes cache timeout in seconds (default: 1.0)

*-o mfsentrycacheto=*'SEC'::
set file entry cache timeout in seconds (default: 0.0, i.e. no cache)

*-o mfsdirentrycacheto=*'SEC'::
set directory entry cache timeout in seconds (default: 1.0)

*-o mfswritecachesize=*'N'::
specify write cache size in MiB (in range: 16..2048 - default: 128)

*-o mfscacheperinodepercentage=*'N'::
specify what part of the write cache non occupied by other inodes can a single inode occupy
(measured in %).
E.g. When N=75 and the inode X uses 10 MiB, and all other inodes use 20 MiB out of 100 MiB cache,
X can use 50 MiB more (since 75% of 80 MiB is 60 MiB).
Default: 25.

*-o mfschunkserverreadto=*'MSEC'::
set timeout for whole communication with a chunkserver during read operation in milliseconds (default: 2000)

*-o mfschunkserverwriteto=*'MSEC'::
set chunkserver response timeout during write operation in milliseconds (default: 5000)

*-o mfschunkserverrtt=*'MSEC'::
set timeout after which SYN packet is considered lost during the first retry of connecting a chunkserver
(default: 200)

*-o mfschunkserverconnectreadto=*'MSEC'::
set timeout for connecting with chunkservers during read operation in milliseconds (default: 2000)

*-o mfschunkserverwavereadto=*'MSEC'::
set timeout for executing each wave of a read operation in milliseconds (default: 500)

*-o mfschunkservertotalreadto=*'MSEC'::
set timeout for the whole communication with chunkservers during a read operation in milliseconds (default: 2000)

*-o cacheexpirationtime=*'MSEC'::
set timeout for read cache entries to be considered valid in milliseconds (0 disables cache) (default: 300)

*-o readaheadmaxwindowsize=*'KB'::
set max value of readahead window per single descriptor in kibibytes (default: 16384)

*-o mfsrlimitnofile=*'N'::
try to change limit of simultaneously opened file descriptors on startup
(default: 100000)

*-o mfsnice=*'LEVEL'::
try to change nice level to specified value on startup (default: -19)

*-o mfswriteworkers=*'N'::
define number of write workers (default: 10)

*-o mfswritewindowsize=*'N'::
define write window size (in blocks) for each chunk (default: 15)

*-o mfsmemlock*::
try to lock memory (must be enabled at build time)

*-o mfsdonotrememberpassword*::
do not remember password in memory - more secure, but when session is lost then new session is
created without password

*-o mfsioretries=*'N'::
specify number of retries before I/O error is returned (default: 30)

*-o mfsreportreservedperiod=*'N'::
specify interval of reporting reserved inodes in seconds (default: 60)

*-o mfsiolimits=*'PATH'::
specify local I/O limiting configuration file (default: no I/O limiting)

General mount options (see *mount*(8) manual):

*-o rw*|*-o ro*::
Mount file-system in read-write (default) or read-only mode respectively.

*-o suid*|*-o nosuid*::
Enable or disable suid/sgid attributes to work.

*-o dev*|*-o nodev*::
Enable or disable character or block special device files interpretation.

*-o exec*|*-o noexec*::
Allow or disallow execution of binaries.

*-o symlinkcachetimeout=*'N'::
Set timeout value for symlink cache timeout in seconds. Default value is 3600.

*-o bandwidthoveruse=*'N'::
Define ratio of allowed bandwidth overuse when fetching data. Default value is 1.0.
This option is effective only with N+M goals (xors and erasure codes).

== DATA CACHE MODES

There are three cache modes: *NO*, *YES* and *AUTO*. Default option is *AUTO* and you shouldn't
change it unless you really know what you are doing. In *AUTO* mode data cache is managed
automatically by mfsmaster.

*NO*,*NONE* or *NEVER*::
never allow files data to be kept in cache (safest but can reduce efficiency)

*YES* or *ALWAYS*::
always allow files data to be kept in cache (dangerous)

*AUTO*::
file cache is managed by mfsmaster automatically (should be very safe and efficient)

== SUGID CLEAR MODE

SMODE can be set to:

 - *NEVER* - MFS will not change suid and sgid bit on chown

 - *ALWAYS* - clear suid and sgid on every chown - safest operation

 - *OSX* - standard behavior in OS X and Solaris (chown made by unprivileged user clear suid
 and sgid)

 - *BSD* - standard behavior in BSD systems (like in OSX, but only when something is really
  changed)

 - *EXT* - standard behavior in most file systems on Linux (directories not changed,
  others: suid cleared always, sgid only when group exec bit is set)

 - *XFS* - standard behavior in XFS on Linux (like EXT but directories are changed
  by unprivileged users)

SMODE extra info:

btrfs,ext2,ext3,ext4,hfs[+],jfs,ntfs and reiserfs on Linux work as 'EXT'.

Only xfs on Linux works a little different. Beware that there is a strange
operation - chown(-1,-1) which is usually converted by a kernel into something
like 'chmod ug-s', and therefore can't be controlled by MFS as 'chown'
