Mount Lizard File System.

General options:

*-h*, *--help*::
Display help and exit.

*-V*::
Display version information and exit.

FUSE options:

*-d*, *-o debug*::
Enable debug mode (implies *-f*).

to *-o nostdmountoptions*.

*--nonempty*::
Allow mounts over non-empty file/dir. Equivalent to *-o nonempty*.

*-p*, *-o askpassword*::
Prompt for password (interactive version of *-o mfspassword=*'PASS').

*-H* 'HOST', *-o mfsmaster=*'HOST'::
Connect with LizardFS master on 'HOST' (default is mfsmaster).

*-P* 'PORT', *-o mfsport=*'PORT'::
Connect with LizardFS master on 'PORT' (default is 9421).

*-B* 'HOST', *-o mfsbind=*'HOST'::
Local address to use for connecting with master instead of default one.

*-S* 'PATH', *-o mfssubfolder=*'PATH'::
Mount specified LizardFS directory (default is */*, i.e. whole filesystem).

*-o enablefilelocks=*[0,1]::
Enables/disables global file locking (disabled by default).

*-o mfspassword=*'PASSWORD'::
Authenticate to LizardFS master with 'PASSWORD'.

*-o mfsmd5pass=*'MD5'::
Authenticate to LizardFS master using directly given 'MD5' (only if
*mfspassword* option is not specified).

*-o mfsdelayedinit*::
Connection with master is done in background - with this option mount can be
run without network (good for being run from fstab / init scripts etc.).

*-o mfsacl*::
Enable ACL support (disabled by default).

*-o mfsaclcacheto=*'SEC'::
Set ACL cache timeout in seconds (default: 1.0).

*-o mfsaclcachesize=*'N'::
Define ACL cache size in number of entries (0: no cache; default: 1000).

When set to 1, parallel reads from the same descriptor are performed (default:
1).

*-o mfsmkdircopysgid=*'N'::
sgid bit should be copied during mkdir operation (on Linux default: 1,
otherwise: 0).

*-o mfssugidclearmode=*'SMODE'::
Set sugid clear mode (see below).

*-o mfsdebug*::
Print some LizardFS-specific debugging information.

*-o mfscachemode=*'CACHEMODE'::
Set cache mode (see *DATA CACHE MODES*; default is AUTO).

*-o mfscachefiles*::
(deprecated) Preserve file data in cache (equivalent to *-o mfscachemode=*'YES').

*-o mfsattrcacheto=*'SEC'::
Set attributes cache timeout in seconds (default: 1.0).

*-o mfscacheperinodepercentage=*'N'::
Specify what part of the write cache non occupied by other inodes can a single
inode occupy (measured in %). E.g. When N=75 and the inode X uses 10 MiB, and
all other inodes use 20 MiB out of 100 MiB cache, X can use 50 MiB more (since
75% of 80 MiB is 60 MiB). Default: 25.

*-o mfschunkserverreadto=*'MSEC'::
Set timeout for whole communication with a chunkserver during read operation in
milliseconds (default: 2000).

*-o mfschunkserverwriteto=*'MSEC'::
Set chunkserver response timeout during write operation in milliseconds
(default: 5000).

*-o mfschunkserverrtt=*'MSEC'::

(default: 500).

*-o mfschunkservertotalreadto=*'MSEC'::
Set timeout for the whole communication with chunkservers during a read
operation in milliseconds (default: 2000).

*-o cacheexpirationtime=*'MSEC'::
Set timeout for read cache entries to be considered valid in milliseconds. 0
disables cache (default: 0).

*-o mfswriteworkers=*'N'::
Define number of write workers (default: 10).

*-o mfswritewindowsize=*'N'::
Define write window size (in blocks) for each chunk (default: 15).

*-o mfsmemlock*::
Try to lock memory (must be enabled at build time).

*-o mfsdonotrememberpassword*::
So not remember password in memory - more secure, but when session is lost then
new session is created without password.

*-o mfsioretries=*'N'::

*-o suid* | *-o nosuid*::

*-o dev* | *-o nodev*::
Enable or disable character or block special device files interpretation.

*-o exec* | *-o noexec*::
Allow or disallow execution of binaries.

== DATA CACHE MODES

There are three cache modes: *NO*, *YES* and *AUTO*. Default option is *AUTO*
and you shouldn't change it unless you really know what you are doing. In
*AUTO* mode data cache is managed automatically by mfsmaster.

*NO*, *NONE* or *NEVER*::
never allow files data to be kept in cache (safest but can reduce efficiency)

*YES* or *ALWAYS*::
always allow files data to be kept in cache (dangerous)

*AUTO*::
file cache is managed by mfsmaster automatically (should be very safe and
efficient)

== SUGID CLEAR MODE

SMODE can be set to:

 - *NEVER* - MFS will not change suid and sgid bit on chown

 - *ALWAYS* - clear suid and sgid on every chown - safest operation

 - *OSX* - standard behavior in OS X and Solaris (chown made by unprivileged
   user clear suid and sgid)

 - *BSD* - standard behavior in BSD systems (like in OSX, but only when
   something is really changed)

 - *EXT* - standard behavior in most file systems on Linux (directories not
   changed, others: suid cleared always, sgid only when group exec bit is set)

 - *XFS* - standard behavior in XFS on Linux (like EXT but directories are
   changed by unprivileged users)

SMODE extra info:

btrfs, ext2, ext3, ext4, hfs[+], jfs, ntfs and reiserfs on Linux work as 'EXT'.

Only xfs on Linux works a little different. Beware that there is a strange
operation - chown(-1,-1) which is usually converted by a kernel into something
like 'chmod ug-s', and therefore can't be controlled by MFS as 'chown'

== FSTAB

Since version 3.13 you can define your `/etc/fstab` LizardFS share with new
scheme:

    lizardfs-master:/ /mnt/lizardfs lzfs default 0 0

instead of old fashioned (still supported for backward compatibility):

    mfsmount /mnt/lizardfs fuse mfssubfolder=/,mfsmaster=lizardfs-master 0 0

This new scheme was implemented to be compliant with scheme introduced by
FUSE's author (read more: https://lwn.net/Articles/221779/).
