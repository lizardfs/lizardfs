mfsgoals.cfg(5)
===============

== NAME

mfsgoals.cfg - replication goals configuration file

== DESCRIPTION

The file *mfsgoals.cfg* contains definitions of the replication goals.

== SYNTAX

Syntax is:

'id' 'name' : 'label' ...

The *#* character starts comments.

== DETAILS

There are 20 replication goals, with 'ids' between 1 and 20, inclusive.
Each file stored on the filesystem refers to some goal id and is
replicated according to the goal currently associated with this id.

By default, goal 1 means one copy on any chunkserver, goal 2 means two
copies on any two chunkservers and so on. The purpose of mfsgoals.cfg
is to override this behavior, when desired. The file is a list of goal
definitions, each consisting of 'id', 'name' and a list of 'labels'.

'id' indicates the goal id to be redefined. If some files are already
assigned this goal id, their effective goal will change.

'name' is a human readable name used by the user interface tools
(mfssetgoal(1), mfsgetgoal(1)).

The list of 'labels' is a list of chunkserver labels as defined in
mfschunkserver.cfg(5).

For each file using this goal and for each label, the system will try to
maintain a copy of the file on some chunkserver with this label.
One label may occur multiple times - in such case the system will create
one copy per each occurence.
The special label _ means "a copy on any chunkserver".

Note that changing the definition of a goal in mfsgoals.cfg affects all
files which currently use given goal id.

== EXAMPLES

Some example goal definitions:

3 3 : _ _ _   # one of the default goals (three copies anywhere)

8 not_important_file : _   # only one copy

11 important_file : _ _

12 local_copy_on_mars : mars _ # at least one copy in the Martian datacenter

13 cached_on_ssd : ssd _

14 very_important_file : _ _ _ _

== SNAPSHOT FILES

Snapshot shares data with the original file until the file receives
modification and diverges from the snapshotted version.
If some snapshot has different goal than its original file, any shared
data are stored according to the goal with higher 'id' of the two.
