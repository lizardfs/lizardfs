mfsgoals.cfg(5)
===============

== NAME

mfsgoals.cfg - replication goals configuration file

== DESCRIPTION

The file *mfsgoals.cfg* contains definitions of the replication goals.

== SYNTAX

Syntax is:

'id' 'name' : $'type' { 'label' ... }

'id' 'name' : 'label' ...

The *#* character starts comments.

== DETAILS

There are 40 replication goals, with 'ids' between 1 and 40, inclusive.
Each file stored on the filesystem refers to some goal id and is
replicated according to the goal currently associated with this id.

By default, goal 1 means one copy on any chunkserver, goal 2 means two
copies on any two chunkservers and so on, until 5 - which is the maximal
default number of copies. The purpose of mfsgoals.cfg is to override this
behavior, when desired. The file is a list of goal definitions, each
consisting of 'id', 'name' and a list of 'labels'. The maximal length
of this list is 40 labels.

'id' indicates the goal id to be redefined. If some files are already
assigned this goal id, their effective goal will change.

'name' is a human readable name used by the user interface tools
(mfssetgoal(1), mfsgetgoal(1)). 'name' can consist of up to 32 alphanumeric
characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _.

'type' specifies goal type - currently supported types are:

	- *std* - for each file using this goal and for each label, the system
	         will try to maintain a copy of the file on some chunkserver
	         with this label.
	- **xor**N - for each file using this goal, the system will split the file
	         into N+1 parts (N ordinary + 1 parity). For reading, any N of
	         the parts are necessary. If labels are specified, parts will
	         be kept on chunkservers with these labels. Otherwise, default wildcard
	         labels will be used. N can be in range from 2 to 9.
	- **ec**(K,M) - for each file using this goal, the system will split the file
	         into K + M parts (K data parts and M parity). For reading, any K of
	         the parts are necessary. If labels are specified, parts will
	         be kept on chunkservers with these labels. Otherwise, default wildcard
	         labels will be used. K can be in range from 2 to 32 and M from 1 to 32.

	If the type is unspecified is is assumed to be *std*.

The list of 'labels' is a list of chunkserver labels as defined in
mfschunkserver.cfg(5). 'label' can consist of up to 32 alphanumeric
characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _.


One label may occur multiple times - in such case the system will create
one copy per each occurrence.
The special label _ means "a copy on any chunkserver".

Note that changing the definition of a goal in mfsgoals.cfg affects all
files which currently use given goal id.

== EXAMPLES

Some example goal definitions:

3 3 : _ _ _   # one of the default goals (three copies anywhere)

8 not_important_file : _   # only one copy

11 important_file : _ _

12 local_copy_on_mars : mars _ # at least one copy in the Martian datacenter

13 cached_on_ssd : ssd _

14 very_important_file : _ _ _ _

15 default_xor3 : $xor3

16 fast_read : $xor2 { ssd ssd hdd }

17 xor5 : $xor5 { hdd } # at least one part on hdd

18 first_ec : $ec(3,1)

19 ec32_ssd : $ec(3,2) { ssd ssd ssd ssd ssd } # all parts on ssd

20 ec53_mixed : $ec(5,3) { hdd ssd hdd _ _ _ _ _ } # two parts on hdd and one part on ssd

== SNAPSHOT FILES

Snapshot shares data with the original file until the file receives
modification and diverges from the snapshotted version.
If some snapshot has different goal than its original file, any shared
data are stored according to the goal with higher 'id' of the two.
