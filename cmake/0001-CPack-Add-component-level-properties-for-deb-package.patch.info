I've patched cmake's cpack DEB generator to support dependencies between
components much like RPM generator. It should fix as well the problem with 
deps build on top of another.

To take advantage of patch you have to recompile cmake:
$ git clone  git://cmake.org/cmake.git && cd cmake
$ ./configure
$ git checkout v2.8.11 # use version you like
$ git apply <path_to_patch_file>
$ make
# make install

Patched cmake allows you to specify dependencies between components with
set(CPACK_DEB_<component>_PACKAGE_DEPENDS "somelib, mypackage-mycomponent")
